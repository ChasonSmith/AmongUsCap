Population	The entire group of individuals about which we want information
Stratified Sample	A sampling method in which the population is first classified into groups of similar individuals and individuals from each group are chosen
Observational Study	A study that observes individuals and measures variables of interest
Experimental Units	The collection of individuals to which treatments are applied
Experimental Study	A study that deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals to measure their responses
Treatment	A specific condition applied to the individuals in an experiment
Convenience Sample	Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach to collect results
Sample	The part of the population from which we actually collect information
Bias	Arises when the design of a study is very likely to underestimate or overestimate the value you want to know
Systematic Sample	A sampling method in which each nth person is chosen to participate in the survey
Response Bias	A systematic pattern of incorrect responses in a sample survey
Random Assignment	A study in which the treatments are assigned to all the experimental units completely by chance
Control Group	A group that receives no treatment or a baseline treatment
Cluster Sample	A sampling method in which you first divide the population into smaller groups that mirror the characteristics of the population and random groups are chosen
Lurking Variable	A variable that is not being measured but could affect the response in an experiment
Simple Random Sample	A sampling method in which individuals from the population are chosen in such a way that every set of individuals has an equal chance to be the sample actually selected
Confounding	This occurs when two variables are associated in such a way that their effects on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other
Undercoverage	When some groups in the population are left out of the process of choosing the sample
Nonresponse	When an individual chosen for the sample can't be contacted or refuses to participate in the sample
Voluntary Response Sample	A sampling method that consists of people who choose to responding to a general appeal survey
Control, Random Assignment, Replication	Name the three principles of experimental design
